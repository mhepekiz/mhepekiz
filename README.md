### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##
#### My career spans many years in Digital Marketing primarily training (and what you learned from this experience management, people skills, etc) Most recently Iâ€™ve improved my software engineering skill set at General Assembly so I can build apps that in my spare time, Iâ€™ve developed several corporate management apps, Iâ€™ve been able to improve legacy code and implement new features according to the clientâ€™s needs. I was also able to increase my expertise in Javascript and improve my understanding of how the layers of a large project come together. 

##### My passion for programming started while I was a kid with Commodore 64, I knew I had to pursue this as my career.

##### I'm currently working at FIXD Automotive ( www.fixd.com ) as a Software Engineer. Working with different teams for development and analytics projects.

##### Still using a Commodore 64 Breadbox with 1541-II Floppy Drive and riding motorcycle around Texas (Triumph Explorer XCx)


#### Let's connect!
