### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##
#### My career spans many years in Digital Marketing primarily training (and what you learned from this experience-- management, people skills, etc) Most recently Iâ€™ve improved my software engineering skill set at General Assembly so I can build apps that in my spare time, Iâ€™ve developed several corporate management apps, Iâ€™ve been able to improve legacy code and implement new features according to the clientâ€™s needs. I was also able to increase my expertise in Javascript and improve my understanding of how the layers of a large project come together.

#### My passion for programming started while I was a kid with Commodore 64, I knew I had to pursue this as my career.
